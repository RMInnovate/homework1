# Acorns Case Study

## Overview

Acorns is a relatively new FinTech company that specializes in micro-investing. Micro-investing allows users to save small sums of money that are collected over time and once the collection reaches a certain threshold, that money is used to buy a fraction of an ETF. Acorns' primary target market are new investors who either don't know much about investing and are overwhelmed or initimted by various investment options such as stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, IRAs, Roth-IRAs, etc. and/or do not have the funds to meet the minimual account thresholds required by traditional brokers such as Fidelity and Vanguard.  As such, their target market has been traditionally ignored by large brokerage companies which makes their market potential huge. Acorns' primary target market includes low-income, non-savvy investors in addition to millenials. As of 2019, Acorns had over 4.5 million users.[1][3][5]

Acorns was co-founded by Walter Cruttenden and Jeff Cruttenden in 2012 and re-launched in August 2014 to include mobile services. Acorns is currently managed by Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Noah Kerner.  Mr. Kerner has an extensive enterpreneurship background and holds a bachelors degree in both Psychology and Economics from Cornell University.[1][5]

Acorns' initial success can be contributed to and measured by the list of top name investors such as:
* PayPal
* BlackRock
* Bain Capital
* DST Global
* NBCUniversal
* Comcast Ventures
* Capital Group
* Greycroft
* eVentures
* TPG
* Rakuten
* Sound Ventures
* Ashton Kutcher
* Kevin Durant
* Jennifer Lopez
* Alex Rodriguez
* Bono
As of Jan 2019, Acorns recievd $105 million in Series E funding, bringing Acorns' valuation to $860 million. Acorns' valuation now exceeds Betterment's, who is the largetst independent robo-advisor in the world. Other competitors include SoFi, Wealthfront, and Stash. [4][6][7]

In addition to becoming the leader in micro-investing, Acorns is dedicated to more humanitirian goals, such as teaching people about investing and personal finance and planting oak trees to fight climate change. Acorns offers a very extensive, easy to read Q&A on finanical terms as part of their website and is integrated into their app. Acorns has also partnered with One Tree Planted to plant 438,000 oak trees to date.[1]


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Acorns offers 3 basic services:
Their montly fees is also simple to understand and is very reasonable for low-income customers:
* Basic
** $1 per month
** Acorns Invest

* Plus
** $2 per month
** Acorns Invest
** Acorns Later

* Premium
** $3 per month
** Acorns Invest
** Acorns Later
** Acorns Spend

Arguably, Acorns' management fees are high compared to other investment options. NerdWallet did an excellent job comparing Acorns' fees to its competitors. Their analysis is detailed below.

^Acorns' fees as a percentage of assets:

|   **Account Balance**   |   **Acorns Invest**   |   **Acorns Later**   |   **Acorns Spend**   |
|   ------------------:   |   :---------------:   |   :--------------:   |   :--------------:   |
|   $100                  |   12%                 |   24%                |   36%                |
|   $500                  |   2.4%                |   4.8%               |   7.2%               |
|   $5,000                |   0.24%               |   0.48%              |   0.72%              |
|   $10,000               |   0.12%               |   0.24%              |   0.36%              |

^For context, Acorns competitors like Wealthfront and Betterment charge 0.25%, and generally offer a higher level of service, with tax assistance, better user interfaces and more diversified portfolios. Stash charges $1 a month for a brokerage account, plus a bank account with a debit card that offers rewards. For $3 a month, Stash gives you those offerings plus a retirement account (a traditional or Roth IRA). We would argue that Acorns provides more value than Stash by way of portfolio management.[4]

Acorns is part of the micro-investing trend. They offer 3 primary services:
- Later
- Spend
- Earn




* Found Money
Acorns has partnered with more than 350 companies, including Airbnb, Walmart, Nike, to give its customers cash back when 




## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?


## Recommendations

Right now Acorns offers a very simple investing structure.  They have their customers answer simple profile questions and based on the customer's response they recommend a certain Acorns ETF based on the customer's risk profile.  The customer is able to choose different ETFs, however, the investement options are pre-defined by their portfolio managers. 

I think this is sufficient for new investors who don't understand:
- how to rate companies 
- how to research companies for growth potential
- the difference between 

However, as the investor matures, not only will they understand more about the markets and potential companies they wannt to invest in, but now they have a substantial amount of savings/investments that they can make their own investment decisions.  My recommendation for Acorns would be to gorw their platform to allow users to invest in stocks at their own risk.  If Acorns is worried about the revenue lost from people investing in stocks directly, they can offer their expert financial advising as a service to those who want to invest directly.


* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
